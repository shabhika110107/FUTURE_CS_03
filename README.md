🔐 Wi-Fi Security Assessment – FUTURE_CS_03
📌 Overview
A basic Wi-Fi security assessment conducted using Kali Linux to identify potential vulnerabilities in a WPA2-PSK encrypted network. The goal was to evaluate password strength, scan for open ports, and detect unauthorized devices.

🧪 Tools Used
nmap – Network scanning and port enumeration

netdiscover – Device discovery on local network

Wireshark – Packet capture and traffic analysis

🧾 Key Findings
Weak Password: Detected (12345678)

Encryption: WPA2-PSK

Open Ports: None found on gateway (192.168.43.1)

Devices: 2 known devices; no unauthorized devices

✅ Recommendations
Use strong, complex passwords (16+ characters, symbols, etc.)

Regularly scan for connected devices

Enable MAC filtering (if available)

Avoid default or predictable passwords

📍 Notes
Assessment was limited by hardware (no external Wi-Fi adapter), but effective for demonstrating basic recon and analysis. Further testing is recommended with a compatible adapter for advanced auditing (e.g., handshake capture).
